This repository contains my **revised** solutions to the 2021 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in Rust.

My aim here is to get more proficient at Rust. Therefore, all solutions were created outside of the competition with ample room for errors and learning.

My puzzle inputs are not part of this repository, as [stipulated by the rules](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying). Instead, they reside in a *private submodule*.

In case you wonder, I use Python for competing from 2022 on (solutions [here](https://github.com/phoyh/aoc-py)). Before it was JavaScript (solutions [here](https://github.com/phoyh/aoc-js)). My 2021 **personal statistics** (times, ranks, scores) are found [here](https://github.com/phoyh/aoc-stats).
